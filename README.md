## Train Schedule
For this assignment, we had to create a train schedule with persistent data. Using Google's Firebase for the database, we implemented the persistent data. You can also add a train to the schedule that will live in the database. The "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" data are calculated using the Moment.js library.
